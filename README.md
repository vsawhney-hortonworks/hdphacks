# Botnet Detection using Hortonworks Cybersecurity Platform (HCP)

Detection of Botnet traffic comprising of various malware across different protocols and performing various actions using [HCP](https://hortonworks.com/products/data-platforms/cybersecurity/) powered by [Apache Metron](http://metron.apache.org/)



### [Dataset](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-ctu13/) Used

The CTU-13 is a dataset of botnet traffic that was captured in the CTU University, Czech Republic, in 2011. The goal of the dataset was to have a large capture of real botnet traffic mixed with normal traffic and background traffic. The CTU-13 dataset consists in thirteen captures (called scenarios) of different botnet samples. On each scenario we executed a specific malware, which used several protocols and performed different actions.
